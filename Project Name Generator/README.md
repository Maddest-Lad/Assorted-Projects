Project-Name-Generator: (Python 3.6.0 in Pycharm)

If you want to run without pycharm this then you don't need the .idea & venv files, as long as the txt files are in the same directry as loadname.py it should work. 

This generator will randomly pick from a random adjective and noun and prints out absurd combinations of them, currently there are 3 diffrent adjective and noun pools.

This project was made in python after I had trouble getting [Kohsuke's](https://github.com/kohsuke/wordnet-random-name) java version working.
